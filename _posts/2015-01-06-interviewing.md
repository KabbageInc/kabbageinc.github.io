We are passionate about making Kabbage a great place to work. There’s the free lunch, state of the art equipment and the ability to make a difference everyday. That is just the beginning, though. The most important part of a great place to work is the team itself. We are very selective in our hiring process, striving only hire people that will make the team better, faster, smarter – and more fun.

This series of posts is intended to help people coming in to interview for a job on the Tech Team in particular. Each group has their own flavor, but across the whole Technology Team this is the general process:

#### Initial phone screen
This is a first review of skills and personality fit. The point of this screen is to decide whether it makes sense to have you come in for a series of face-to-face interviews. The key at this point is to be yourself. Most of our people doing phone screens appreciate having a conversation, rather than leading an interrogation. You need to demonstrate technical competency, but we will make sure that happens before we get off the phone. As you will see below, we invest heavily in interviews, so we are picky about who we bring in beyond the phone screen.

#### Technical Test
This is different for each team. On the development team, you will sit at a computer and work on code. Our analysis team has a written case study for you to respond to. On other teams, it will be an in-depth review of your technical knowledge by one of our senior engineers or analysts.

Most people find this part of the day difficult. We want to understand the limits of your technical knowledge. No one has a mastery of every subject, so we want to know where you are strong and where you are weak. You should know that almost 50% of our candidates do not make it past this phase of the process.

#### Team Panel
These interviews are normally conversations with several people at once; we will bring the whole team if we can. You will field technical and personal questions. There is some flow-over from the technical evaluation. We will likely ask you to write code on a whiteboard during this panel. We want to know why you make certain technical decisions. We want to know whether you will be a personality fit for the team. The best of these panel interviews are a lot of fun.

#### Lunch/social time
Let’s face it; we’re going to spend a lot of time together. It’s important to know if we are going to get along. We have lunch catered in the office everyday, so we’ll grab lunch and head into a conference room or hang out in our team area. We are all a lot more relaxed at this point. We would love to hear about your life outside of work. Hopefully, we’ll both feel like it would be fun to work together.

#### Review
After lunch, the team is going to take some time alone to talk about you. They are going to be candid and frank about whether they think you will be a good fit. Everyone has a voice and can make the case for or against you. We really like for the team to have consensus about moving forward, so sometimes this takes a few minutes. The team manager plays a “facilitator” role in this conversation. It is hugely important to us that everyone is comfortable moving forward. Even after all the time we have spent together, we still only move forward with about half of the candidates that make it this far.

#### Head of Technology Interview
If the team approves, you will move on to interview with me. If you have come this far, I can trust that you have the technical skills we are looking for, so we don’t spend a lot of time on that. Most of our conversation will be focused on short case problems that I use to understand your ability to dig in and solve ambiguous problems. More on that process in another post. About 3 outpeople that make it this far move on to the next round.

#### Kabbageheads Panel
In this phase, you will meet the founders and CFO of the company. They meet everyone that gets hired at Kabbage. The main point of this interview is culture fit.

If everything goes well, you will next talk to Amy so she can start the process of preparing an offer. If we do decide to make you an offer, you will hear from us quickly, normally within 48 hours.

#### Wrapping it up
This is a long day; it is a big investment for both of us. My advice to everyone that comes to interview at Kabbage is that you should take this time to get to know us as much as we are trying to get to know you. Kabbage is like that friend you have with a really strong personality: people either love him or hate him, there is no lukewarm response. If you like our brand of hard work and fun, this is going to be the best job you’ve ever had.

Good luck!
